Your task is to write a test for the following function:
```
quill-delta.AttributeMap.diff(a = {}, b = {})
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function diff(a = {}, b = {}) {
        if (typeof a !== 'object') {
            a = {};
        }
        if (typeof b !== 'object') {
            b = {};
        }
        const attributes = Object.keys(a)
            .concat(Object.keys(b))
            .reduce((attrs, key) => {
            if (!isEqual(a[key], b[key])) {
                attrs[key] = b[key] === undefined ? null : b[key];
            }
            return attrs;
        }, {});
        return Object.keys(attributes).length > 0 ? attributes : undefined;
    }
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment:
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let quill_delta = require('quill-delta');
describe('test quill_delta', function() {
    it('test quill-delta.AttributeMap.diff', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a test suite containing a few self-contained unit tests.  The tests should not rely on any 
external resources. For example, a test should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block.

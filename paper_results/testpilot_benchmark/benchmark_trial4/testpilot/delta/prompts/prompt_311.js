Your task is to write a test for the following function:
```
quill-delta.prototype.changeLength()
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
changeLength() {
        return this.reduce((length, elem) => {
            if (elem.insert) {
                return length + Op_1.default.length(elem);
            }
            else if (elem.delete) {
                return length - elem.delete;
            }
            return length;
        }, 0);
    }
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment:
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let quill_delta = require('quill-delta');
describe('test quill_delta', function() {
    it('test quill-delta.prototype.changeLength', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a test suite containing a few self-contained unit tests.  The tests should not rely on any 
external resources. For example, a test should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block.

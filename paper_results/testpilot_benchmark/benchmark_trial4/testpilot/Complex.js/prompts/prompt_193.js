Your task is to write a test for the following function:
```
// Calculate the complex acosh
// @returns {Complex}

complex.js.ZERO.acosh()
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function() {

      // acosh(c) = log(c + sqrt(c^2 - 1))

      var res = this['acos']();
      if (res['im'] <= 0) {
        var tmp = res['re'];
        res['re'] = -res['im'];
        res['im'] = tmp;
      } else {
        var tmp = res['im'];
        res['im'] = -res['re'];
        res['re'] = tmp;
      }
      return res;
    }
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment:
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let complex_js = require('complex.js');
describe('test complex_js', function() {
    it('test complex.js.ZERO.acosh', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a test suite containing a few self-contained unit tests.  The tests should not rely on any 
external resources. For example, a test should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block.

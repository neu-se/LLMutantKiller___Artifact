Your task is to write a test for the following function:
```
pull-stream.filter(test)
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function filter (test) {
  //regexp
  test = tester(test)
  return function (read) {
    return function next (end, cb) {
      var sync, loop = true
      while(loop) {
        loop = false
        sync = true
        read(end, function (end, data) {
          if(!end && !test(data))
            return sync ? loop = true : next(end, cb)
          cb(end, data)
        })
        sync = false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment:
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let pull_stream = require('pull-stream');
describe('test pull_stream', function() {
    it('test pull-stream.filter', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a test suite containing a few self-contained unit tests.  The tests should not rely on any 
external resources. For example, a test should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block.

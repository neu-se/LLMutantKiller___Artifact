Your task is to write a test for the following function:
```
// Calculate the complex exponent and subtracts one.
// This may be more accurate than `Complex(x).exp().sub(1)` if
// `x` is small.
// @returns {Complex}

complex.js.ZERO.expm1()
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function() {

      /**
       * exp(a + i*b) - 1
       = exp(a) * (cos(b) + j*sin(b)) - 1
       = expm1(a)*cos(b) + cosm1(b) + j*exp(a)*sin(b)
       */

      var a = this['re'];
      var b = this['im'];

      return new Complex(
        Math.expm1(a) * Math.cos(b) + cosm1(b),
        Math.exp(a) * Math.sin(b));
    }
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment:
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let complex_js = require('complex.js');
describe('test complex_js', function() {
    it('test complex.js.ZERO.expm1', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a test suite containing a few self-contained unit tests.  The tests should not rely on any 
external resources. For example, a test should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block.

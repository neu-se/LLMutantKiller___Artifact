Your task is to write a test for the following function:
```
// Ceils the actual complex number
// @returns {Complex}

complex.js.ZERO.ceil(places)
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function(places) {

      places = Math.pow(10, places || 0);

      return new Complex(
        Math.ceil(this['re'] * places) / places,
        Math.ceil(this['im'] * places) / places);
    }
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment:
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let complex_js = require('complex.js');
describe('test complex_js', function() {
    it('test complex.js.ZERO.ceil', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a test suite containing a few self-contained unit tests.  The tests should not rely on any 
external resources. For example, a test should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block.

Your task is to write a test for the following function:
```
quill-delta.AttributeMap.compose(a = {}, b = {}, keepNull = false)
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function compose(a = {}, b = {}, keepNull = false) {
        if (typeof a !== 'object') {
            a = {};
        }
        if (typeof b !== 'object') {
            b = {};
        }
        let attributes = cloneDeep(b);
        if (!keepNull) {
            attributes = Object.keys(attributes).reduce((copy, key) => {
                if (attributes[key] != null) {
                    copy[key] = attributes[key];
                }
                return copy;
            }, {});
        }
        for (const key in a) {
            if (a[key] !== undefined && b[key] === undefined) {
                attributes[key] = a[key];
            }
        }
        return Object.keys(attributes).length > 0 ? attributes : undefined;
    }
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment:
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let quill_delta = require('quill-delta');
describe('test quill_delta', function() {
    it('test quill-delta.AttributeMap.compose', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a test suite containing a few self-contained unit tests.  The tests should not rely on any 
external resources. For example, a test should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block.

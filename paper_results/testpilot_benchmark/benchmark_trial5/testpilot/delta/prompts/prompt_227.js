Your task is to write a test for the following function:
```
quill-delta.prototype.chop()
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
chop() {
        const lastOp = this.ops[this.ops.length - 1];
        if (lastOp && typeof lastOp.retain === 'number' && !lastOp.attributes) {
            this.ops.pop();
        }
        return this;
    }
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment:
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let quill_delta = require('quill-delta');
describe('test quill_delta', function() {
    it('test quill-delta.prototype.chop', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a test suite containing a few self-contained unit tests.  The tests should not rely on any 
external resources. For example, a test should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block.

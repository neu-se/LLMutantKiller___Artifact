Your task is to write a test for the following function:
```
// Subtracts two complex numbers
// @returns {Complex}

complex.js.ZERO.sub(a, b)
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function(a, b) {

      var z = new Complex(a, b);

      // Infinity - Infinity = NaN
      if (this['isInfinite']() && z['isInfinite']()) {
        return Complex['NAN'];
      }

      // Infinity - z = Infinity { where z != Infinity }
      if (this['isInfinite']() || z['isInfinite']()) {
        return Complex['INFINITY'];
      }

      return new Complex(
        this['re'] - z['re'],
        this['im'] - z['im']);
    }
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment:
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let complex_js = require('complex.js');
describe('test complex_js', function() {
    it('test complex.js.ZERO.sub', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a test suite containing a few self-contained unit tests.  The tests should not rely on any 
external resources. For example, a test should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block.

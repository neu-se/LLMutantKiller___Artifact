Your task is to write a test for the following function:
```
q.denodeify(callback /*...args*/)
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function (callback /*...args*/) {
    if (callback === undefined) {
        throw new Error("Q can't wrap an undefined function");
    }
    var baseArgs = array_slice(arguments, 1);
    return function () {
        var nodeArgs = baseArgs.concat(array_slice(arguments));
        var deferred = defer();
        nodeArgs.push(deferred.makeNodeResolver());
        Q(callback).fapply(nodeArgs).fail(deferred.reject);
        return deferred.promise;
    };
}
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment:
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let q = require('q');
describe('test q', function() {
    it('test q.denodeify', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a test suite containing a few self-contained unit tests.  The tests should not rely on any 
external resources. For example, a test should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block.

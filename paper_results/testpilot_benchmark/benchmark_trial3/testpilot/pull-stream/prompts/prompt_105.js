Your task is to write a test for the following function:
```
pull-stream.map(mapper)
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function map (mapper) {
  if(!mapper) return id
  mapper = prop(mapper)
  return function (read) {
    return function (abort, cb) {
      read(abort, function (end, data) {
        try {
        data = !end ? mapper(data) : null
        } catch (err) {
          return read(err, function () {
            return cb(err)
          })
        }
        cb(end, data)
      })
    }
  }
}
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment:
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let pull_stream = require('pull-stream');
describe('test pull_stream', function() {
    it('test pull-stream.map', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a test suite containing a few self-contained unit tests.  The tests should not rely on any 
external resources. For example, a test should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block.

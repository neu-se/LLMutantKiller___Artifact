Your task is to write a test for the following function:
```
pull-stream.unique(field, invert)
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function unique (field, invert) {
  field = prop(field) || id
  var seen = {}
  return filter(function (data) {
    var key = field(data)
    if(seen[key]) return !!invert //false, by default
    else seen[key] = true
    return !invert //true by default
  })
}
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment:
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let pull_stream = require('pull-stream');
describe('test pull_stream', function() {
    it('test pull-stream.unique', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a test suite containing a few self-contained unit tests.  The tests should not rely on any 
external resources. For example, a test should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block.

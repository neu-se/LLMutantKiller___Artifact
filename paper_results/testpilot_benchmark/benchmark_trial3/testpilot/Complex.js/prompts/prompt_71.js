Your task is to write a test for the following function:
```
complex.js.ZERO.sqrt()
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function() {

      var a = this['re'];
      var b = this['im'];
      var r = this['abs']();

      var re, im;

      if (a >= 0) {

        if (b === 0) {
          return new Complex(Math.sqrt(a), 0);
        }

        re = 0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r + a));
      } else {
        re = Math.abs(b) / Math.sqrt(2 * (r - a));
      }

      if (a <= 0) {
        im = 0.5 * Math.sqrt(2.0 * (r - a));
      } else {
        im = Math.abs(b) / Math.sqrt(2 * (r + a));
      }

      return new Complex(re, b < 0 ? -im : im);
    }
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment:
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let complex_js = require('complex.js');
describe('test complex_js', function() {
    it('test complex.js.ZERO.sqrt', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a test suite containing a few self-contained unit tests.  The tests should not rely on any 
external resources. For example, a test should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block.

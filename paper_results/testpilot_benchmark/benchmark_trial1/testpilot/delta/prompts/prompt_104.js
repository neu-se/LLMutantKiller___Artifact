Your task is to write a test for the following function:
```
quill-delta.prototype.partition(predicate)
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
partition(predicate) {
        const passed = [];
        const failed = [];
        this.forEach((op) => {
            const target = predicate(op) ? passed : failed;
            target.push(op);
        });
        return [passed, failed];
    }
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment:
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let quill_delta = require('quill-delta');
describe('test quill_delta', function() {
    it('test quill-delta.prototype.partition', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a test suite containing a few self-contained unit tests.  The tests should not rely on any 
external resources. For example, a test should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block.

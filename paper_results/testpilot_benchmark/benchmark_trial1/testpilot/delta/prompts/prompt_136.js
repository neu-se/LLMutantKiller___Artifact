Your task is to write a test for the following function:
```
quill-delta.prototype.concat(other)
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
concat(other) {
        const delta = new Delta(this.ops.slice());
        if (other.ops.length > 0) {
            delta.push(other.ops[0]);
            delta.ops = delta.ops.concat(other.ops.slice(1));
        }
        return delta;
    }
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment:
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let quill_delta = require('quill-delta');
describe('test quill_delta', function() {
    it('test quill-delta.prototype.concat', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a test suite containing a few self-contained unit tests.  The tests should not rely on any 
external resources. For example, a test should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block.

Your task is to write a test for the following function:
```
complex.js(a, b)
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function Complex(a, b) {

    if (!(this instanceof Complex)) {
      return new Complex(a, b);
    }

    var z = parse(a, b);

    this['re'] = z['re'];
    this['im'] = z['im'];
  }
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment:
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let complex_js = require('complex.js');
describe('test complex_js', function() {
    it('test complex.js', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a test suite containing a few self-contained unit tests.  The tests should not rely on any 
external resources. For example, a test should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block.

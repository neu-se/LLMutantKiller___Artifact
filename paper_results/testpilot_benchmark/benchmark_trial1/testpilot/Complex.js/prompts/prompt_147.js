Your task is to write a test for the following function:
```
// Calculate the complex arcus tangent
// @returns {Complex}

complex.js.ZERO.atan()
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function() {

      // atan(c) = i / 2 log((i + x) / (i - x))

      var a = this['re'];
      var b = this['im'];

      if (a === 0) {

        if (b === 1) {
          return new Complex(0, Infinity);
        }

        if (b === -1) {
          return new Complex(0, -Infinity);
        }
      }

      var d = a * a + (1.0 - b) * (1.0 - b);

      var t1 = new Complex(
        (1 - b * b - a * a) / d,
        -2 * a / d).log();

      return new Complex(-0.5 * t1['im'], 0.5 * t1['re']);
    }
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment:
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let complex_js = require('complex.js');
describe('test complex_js', function() {
    it('test complex.js.ZERO.atan', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a test suite containing a few self-contained unit tests.  The tests should not rely on any 
external resources. For example, a test should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.

Provide your answer as a fenced code block.

Your task is to write a test for the following function:
```
q.Promise.race(answerPs)
```

This function is defined as follows:
```
function race(answerPs) {
    return promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        // Switch to this once we can assume at least ES5
        // answerPs.forEach(function (answerP) {
        //     Q(answerP).then(resolve, reject);
        // });
        // Use this in the meantime
        for (var i = 0, len = answerPs.length; i < len; i++) {
            Q(answerPs[i]).then(resolve, reject);
        }
    });
}
```

Please proceed by modifying the following code fragment:
```
let mocha = require('mocha');
let assert = require('assert');
let q = require('q');
describe('test q', function() {
    it('test q.Promise.race', function(done) {
``` 
so that it becomes a test suite containing a few self-contained unit tests.  The tests should not rely on any 
external resources. For example, a test should not attempt to access files that it does not create itself.
